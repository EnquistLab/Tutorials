# Tutorials

This repo is intended to be a go-to place for short tutorials on basic and not-so-basic computer skills. Most tutorials will be unix-related, but I may cover other non-OS specific topics such as git/github, SQL, or markdown (the markup language I'm using to write this document). 

If you're interested in contributing a tutorial, shoot me a message and I'll give you write access to the repo.
