# Tutorials

This repo is intended to be used as a quick go-to place for short, focused tutorials covering different aspects of basic and not-so-basic computer science skills. Most tutorials will be unix-related, but I (and whoever else contributes to this repo) may cover other non-OS specific topics such as git/github, SQL, or markdown (the markup language I'm using to write this document). The emphasis is on languages, applications and command-line skills relevant to working with Big (or Big-ish) data within the unix/linux ecosystem.

If you're interested in contributing a tutorial, shoot me a message and I'll give you write access to the repo.
