# Tutorials

This repo is intended to be used as a quick go-to place for tutorials covering various computational skills for biodiverity informatics. Most will be unix-related, but I (and whoever else contributes to this repo) may cover other topics such as git/github, SQL, or markdown (the mark-up language I'm using to write this document. The emphasis is on languages, applications and command-line skills relevant to working with Big (or Big-ish) data within the unix/linux ecosystem.

If you're interested in contributing a tutorial, shoot me a message and I'll give you write access to the repo.
