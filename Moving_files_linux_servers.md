## Introduction

This gives a quick overview of some lightweight and reliable command-line tools you can used to transfer files to unix servers such as the BIEN servers. If you have passwordless authentication set up on the BIEN server, you can run these commands without having to enter a password, which makes them ideal for automated use in scripts. The BIEN server administrators (current Brad Boyle and Nick Outin) can help you set up passwordless authentication.

### scp (secure copy)

Copy `file` to user's home directory

```
scp /path/to/file <username>@<server_address>
```

E.g.,

```
scp mybigfile.zip boyle@ceiba.nceas.ucsb.edu 
```

Copy file to subdirectory in user's home directory:

```
scp /path/to/file <username>@<server_address>:destination/path/in/users/home/directory/ 
```
E.g., 

```
scp mybigfile.zip boyle@ceiba.nceas.ucsb.edu:data/ 
```
Notes:
* If you havenâ€™t set a passwordless SSH login to the remote machine, you will be asked to enter the user password.
* If you are transferring a bunch of files, or multiple files insides directories and subdirectories, you should generally tar & compress them first, then transfer with scp and uncompress on the other end:

#### Example: copy directory `mybigdirectoryfulloffiles/` to directory `data/` in my home directory on ceiba:

Compress and transfer from the source machine:

```
tar -czf mybigdirectoryfulloffiles.tar.gz mybigdirectoryfulloffiles
scp mybigdirectoryfulloffiles.tar.gz boyle@ceiba.nceas.ucsb.edu:data/ 
```

Uncompress on the target machine:

```
cd ~/data
tar -xzf mybigdirectoryfulloffiles.tar.gz
```

Note:
* For deep tree structures with many directories and many files, compressing & tarring can be very time comsuming. In such cases, rsync without compression may be substantially faster.


### rsync

Rsync transfers files by parts. It can resume transfers when connections are interrupted. It can transfer entire directories, and is commonly used to back up files because it compares and copies only the parts that have changed. Consider using rsync if (a) you are transfering very large files (rsync can resume an interrupted file transfer), (b) you need to transfer many files at once (rsync is very efficient at reading deeply nested file structures), or (c) any time connectivity problems may interfere with data transfers. 

To work properly, rsync needs to be installed on both machines. All our servers have rsync installed. If you have passwordless authentication set up, basic rsync commands look much like scp.

On the source machine:

```
rsync -avz myfile boyle@ceiba.nceas.ucsb.edu:data/
```

If the transfer will take a very long time, run the command in `screen`.

If the connection is weak or intermittent, wrapping rsync in the following bash script will allow your transfer to resume on its own until the transfer is complete. You must have passwordless authentication for this to work.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Parameters
SOURCEFILE="path/to/you/file"
REMOTE_USER="remote_server_user_name"
SERVER_ADDRESS="remote_server_address_or_IP"
DEST_DIR="destination_directory_with_trailing_slash"

# Main
while [ 1 ]
do
    rsync -avz --partial ${SOURCEFILE} ${REMOTE_USER}@${SERVER_ADDRESS}:${DEST_DIR}
    if [ "$?" = "0" ] ; then
        echo "rsync completed normally"
        exit
    else
        echo "Rsync failure. Backing off and retrying..."
        sleep 180
    fi
done
```

Notes:
* If you need a more full-featured version of the above script, with error-checking and the ability to set all parameters on the command line, let me know and I will tweak it for you.  
* Rsync has ***tons*** of options. Be sure to check them out: `man rsync`.  
* For more rsync examples, including options for parallelization, see this excellent article: http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/HOWTO_move_data.html.

## From Windows

I haven't tried these solutions personally, but they sound reasonable. I anyone has updated information or better options, feel free to modify.

### pscp
If you are running PowerShell, you can use executable pscp.exe, which is roughly equivalent to scp:

```
pscp -pw password /path/to/file/myfile boyle@ceiba.nceas.ucsb.edu:data/ 
```
* This sends the password as plain text (not recommended!)

As a safer option, if you have passwordless authentication set up on the remote machine, you can do this instead:

```
pscp -i /path/to/file/myfile boyle@ceiba.nceas.ucsb.edu:data/ 
```

### Git BASH (rsync)

I haven't used it, but apparently there is a bash-shell simulator for Windows that includes rsync: Git BASH (https://gitforwindows.org/). See discussion at https://superuser.com/a/915733/1136490.

Here's an example from the above superuser post:

```
bash -c "rsync -avz -P --stats --timeout=60 --exclude Downloads . my_remote_linux_computer@128.95.155.200:/media/my_remote_linux_computer/LaCie/My\\ Documents"
```
